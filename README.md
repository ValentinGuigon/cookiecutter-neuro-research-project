# Cookiecutter Research Project

A bare-bones cookiecutter for a research project in python and/or MATLAB.

## Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
* [Conda package manager](https://conda.io/en/latest/) (I recommend the lightweight version [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
* [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html)

You can install [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) easily with conda.

``` bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```

## Quickstart
To start a new project, run:
``` bash
$ cookiecutter gh:jessecusack/cookiecutter-research-project
```
(*this should be run from the location that you want the project folder to live, or you will need to move the directory around later*)
